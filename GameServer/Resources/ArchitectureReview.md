# Guidelines
* What style are you going to use? 
* What is the structure?
* How is it going to function? 
* How do structural components of the architecture work together?
* How does it meet the needs of all the stakeholders? 

# Architecture issues

# Quality attributes

## Availability
### Definition
* The proportion of time the system is up and running.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Deployability
### Definition
* How quickly can you deploy the system?
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Efficiency
### Definition
* Deals with the use of the resources available for execution of software, and how this impacts response times, throughput and storage consumption. 
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Extensibility
### Definition
* New feature implementation/replacement of components with improved versions and the removal of unwanted or unnecessary features or components.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Functionality
### Definition
* Ability of the system to do the work for which it was intended.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Integrity
### Definition
* Underlying theme or vision that unifies the design of the system at all levels.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Interoperability
### Definition
* Interaction with other sub-subsystem, or a well defined access to externally-visible functionality and data structures or interaction with other run-time environments.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Maintainability
### Definition
* Problem fixing, repairing a software system after errors occur.
* Include to the infrastructure, tools, and staff of administrators and technicians needed to maintain the health of the application.
* Preparing application for easy and efficient debugging . Registration of abnormal behaviour. Real-time monitoring.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Modifiability
### Definition
* Ability to make changes to a system quickly and cost effectively.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Performance
### Definition
* The time required to respond to stimuli (events) or the number of events processed in some interval of time.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Portability
### Definition
* Ability of the system to run under different computing environments.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Productivity
### Definition
Cost and time saving mechanism to aid development of applications based on the software architecture. The developers should be able to learn the architecture concept and how to implement it easily. Extending the development team with new developers should not cost much effort in instruction, etc.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Reliability
### Definition
* The ability of the system to keep operating over time in the context of application and system errors and in situations of unexpected or incorrect usage (to perform in a predictable manner).
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Scalability
### Definition
* Number of user changes while maintaining other qualities. Support continuous growth to meet user demand and business complexity. It must be possible to extend the minimum hardware configuration needed for the application with additional hardware to support increased workloads.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Security
### Definition
* Measure of the system's ability to resist unauthorized attempts at usage and denial of service.
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Usability
### Definition
* How easy is it to use the program?
### Key success metrics
### Notes

## Testability
### Definition
* How easy is it to test code a unit, sub-systems, etc.
