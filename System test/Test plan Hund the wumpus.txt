Test risk:

	- Testing scope delaydue to a new defect found
	- Testing shedule delay due to sickness or natural disasters
	- Testig is done based on incomplet validation, failing to establish testing priorities, or improper communication 
	establishes an operational risk
	-Testing done without access to requirements established on operational risk
